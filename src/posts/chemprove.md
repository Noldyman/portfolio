Chemprove was the first _real_ application that I created when I started learning programming. While following online courses, I had already created some small programs. However, up to that point, I hadn't actually used any of these in my day-to-day life. To change that, I decided to make an application that would help me with my job as an organic chemist.

Within the company where I work, people use a variety of Excel sheets, web pages, and standard tables to aid them with repetitive tasks and calculations. My goal with Chemprove was to combine all these tools into one web application.

For example, on the website, you can perform basic calculations with concentrations or make use of the unit converter.

However, Chemprove becomes a lot more interesting when you use it to work out analyses. Note that the molecular structure of the molecules you synthesize cannot be seen by the naked eye, not even with a microscope. Therefore, all the products that you synthesize need to be analyzed with special equipment. Often, you perform a variety of analyses to determine if the synthesis was successful or not.

When conducting these types of analyses, you often perform repetitive calculations or look up the same kind of data. Two very common analysis techniques are **NMR** and **LC-MS**. I created some handy tools for both of these techniques. For example, I made tools that help you identify impurities or calculate the purity of the product you synthesized.

Many colleagues started using the website and provided me with really helpful feedback and suggestions! That allowed me to further improve the site and add new functionalities.

I don't want to bore you by going into too much detail about how all the tools work. But if you're genuinely interested, let me know. I would be happy to explain!

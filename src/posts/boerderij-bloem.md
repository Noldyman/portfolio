Boerderij Bloem is a small-scale organic farm located in Nijmegen Noord. I am currently developing a new website for the owners to share information, news about the farm, and advertise their products.

I'm currently working on two separate applications: the website itself and a simple content management system (CMS).

I will provide more details once the website is up and running.
